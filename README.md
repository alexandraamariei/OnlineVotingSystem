 OnlineVotingSystem(Python + Tkinter)

This is a demonstration project of a simple voting system with a graphical interface. The application allows voters to authenticate based on their CNP (Personal Numeric Code) and place of birth, choose a candidate, and display real-time results in a graphical format. It prevents voting twice with the same CNP.

Functionalities:

-CNP Validation (format, age, county, control digit)
-Double-voting prevention
-Graphical user interface with Tkinter
-Real-time results display with Matplotlib
